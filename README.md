You can copy this code directly into your `README.md` file at the root of your project, it will render perfectly formatted on GitHub.  

Would you like me to make a **slightly more visually styled** version (with emojis, section dividers, and badges for React, TypeScript, etc.) to make it stand out more to recruiters?
